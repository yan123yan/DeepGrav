### Overall Project Overview
This repository contains the training code and submissions for the NSF HDR A3D3 competition, which focused on detecting anomalous gravitational wave signals. 
Our work introduces a novel deep learning-based approach that leverages an improved network architecture inspired by ResNet. 
By incorporating residual blocks and high-dimensional feature projections, our method robustly distinguishes background noise from gravitational wave signalsâ€”even on unseen datasets. 
The project demonstrates exceptional prediction performance (with a final True Negative Rate of 0.9832).
